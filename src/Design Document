LinearEquation class
Instance variables:
private int x- variable that represent the first x-coordinate
private int y- represents the y-coordinate
private double x2-represents the second x-coordinate
private double y2-represents the corresponding y-coordinate according to x2

Constructor:
public LinearEquation(int x, int y)
public LinearEquation(int x2)

Methods:
public double CalculateDistance()
This method will calculate the distance between the x and y coordinates.
Return the result to the nearest hundredth as a double

public double CalculateInfo()
This method will calculate the slope and the y-intercept of the linear equation
Return results to the nearest hundredth as a double

public String toString()
This method puts the local variables(y-intercept, slope) into a slope-intercept form.
This method can return the x and y coordinate,slope, y-intercept,the distance between the two points,and the equation of the line in slope-intercept form as a String.

public String CalculateCoordinatePoint()
This method calculate the coordinate point corresponding to the instance variable x-2
Return the result as a string.


EquationRunner.java
1.Welcome the user, and ask them to enter first coordinate pair in coordinate form(String)

2.Create a new LinearEquation object.

3.Calculate and print the following:
a.The two original points
b.the equation of the line in slope-intercept form
c.the slope
d.the y-intercept
e.the distance between two points

4. ask the user to enter an x-value(instance variable x2)

5.calculate the y-coordinate by using slope-intercept form

6.prints out the point(x2,y2) alone with step 3.
